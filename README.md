# FuckCDN
Fuckcdn is an alternative to old-school CDNs

For the developpers who wants to protect the privacy of the users, just put "fuckcdn.domain.tld/" between "https://" and the CDN.
For ajax.googleapis.com and fuckcdn.nsa.ovh : https://fuckcdn.nsa.ovh/ajax.googleapis.com/some/random/ressource

For a user, you can bind thoses old-school CDN to your instance.
You can do it by editing the entries in your local resolver or editing your host file.

So each time you call for a cdn, the request will be handled by your instance, a big plus for privacy.
